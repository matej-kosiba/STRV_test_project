# STRV_test_project
My solution for the STRV's test project for Data Engineer position.

File and Folder organisation:
file 'main.py' is the script that runs the analysis, most importantly, it imports functions that do the analysis from the second python file, 'functions.py'

Folder 'Documents' contains 2 PDF files:
'STRV_Test_Project_documenting_my_process' is a PDF documentation of the process of my work
'STRV_Test_Project_presentation' is a PDF presentation for the initial conversation with the startup about their project's vision

Folder 'Results':
It contains outputs of the analysis run by 'main.py'
These are mostly figures on linear regression fitting to get the slope for finding the most trending names, and the histograms of the occurrence change over time for a name
